# Advertising Sales Prediction with Monitoring and Sustainability  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores machine learning model development and monitoring using **Linear Regression**.  
The main task was to predict product sales based on advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper).  
Beyond building the model, I also integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time monitoring,  
and used **CodeCarbon** to track the environmental impact of training the models.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build and train a Linear Regression model on the Advertising dataset.  
- Evaluate performance using MSE, RMSE, and R².  
- Integrate Prometheus for exposing performance metrics.  
- Use Grafana for dashboard visualization.  
- Track carbon emissions using CodeCarbon.  
- Experiment with synthetic data and simulated metrics.
